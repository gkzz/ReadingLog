## 4-1. Overview

This chapter's topic is as follows:

- `Diversity` is required.

- The reasons are as follows:
  - In order to exclude biases, which are everywhere, because of that, some mistakes occur.
  - In order to increase imbalance of power between the decision makers and those who are not

### 4-1-1. My questions

#### Q1. How do they recruit a diverse workforce?
- Evitable that interviewers and interviewees are similar.
  - Not being aggressive with referrals?
  - Extremely difficult to decide that you should hire someone who is difficult for you to understand?

> Engineers should focus on people who are different than themselves, especially people who might attempt to use their products to cause harm. 

- The following may be crue:

> `by building in inclusive design from the start and raising development standards for development` to make tools delightful and accessible for people who struggle to access technology, we `enhance the experience for all users.`

- The following is what I cannnot understand.
  - The highlighted is what I cannot especially.

>  The recruiters were focused on minimizing wasted time for hiring managers and applicants, and they presented the development team with use cases focused on scale and efficiency for those people. To drive efficiency, `the recruiters asked the engineering team to include a feature that would highlight performance ratings—specifically lower ratings—to the hiring manager and recruiter as soon as an internal transfer expressed interest in a job.`


## 4-2. what this chapter reminded me

- That is the following peter thiel's sayings.

> `“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”`
>
> This question sounds easy because it’s straightforward. Actually, it’s very hard to answer. It’s intellectually difficult because the knowledge that everyone is taught in school is by definition agreed upon. And it’s psychologically difficult because anyone trying to answer must say something she knows to be unpopular. Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.
