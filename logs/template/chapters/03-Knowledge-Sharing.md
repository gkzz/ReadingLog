## 3-1. Overview

- There are more and more situations where there is only one person who can solve certain problems, as the size of the company grows.

- The key to solve this problem is `knowledge sharing`

### 3-1-1. Concerns about sharing knowledge

- There are some trade-offs:
  - More scalabile, more unapplicable to individual learners' situations

  - More documents, more difficult maintenance

### 3-1-2. Why is `knowledge sharing` the key to solving the problem?

- The number of people who can solve a problem won't increase unless the knowledge of the best people who can solve the problem is shared.
- No choices but to train your experts, who write more documents

### 3-1-3. What do you need in order to start `knowledge sharing`?

This book says:

- Psychological safety is critical to promoting a learning environment.
  - e.g.: `Mentorship`, Group solutions

    > One important way of building psychological safety is to assign Nooglers `a mentor—someone who is not their team member, manager, or tech lead—whose responsibilities explicitly include answering questions and helping the Noogler ramp up.` Having an officially assigned mentor to ask for help makes it easier for the newcomer and means that they don’t need to worry about taking up too much of their coworkers’ time.

  \* Noogler is equals to new Googleer

## 3-2. What impressed me

- `Chesterton's fence`
  >「フェンスが存在するのならば、そこには何かしらの理由がある」と解説し、この主張から得られる教訓を「そもそもフェンスが設置された理由を理解するまで、フェンスを撤去するな」
