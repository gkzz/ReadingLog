## 2-1. Overview
- `The book explains as follows:

  > The critical idea in this chapter is that `software development is a team endeavor`. And to succeed on an engineering team—or in any other creative collaboration—`you need to reorganize your behaviors around the core principles of humility, respect, and trust`.


### 2-1-1. Be afraid of to be criticized

Help Me Hide My Code

>insecurity is just a part of human nature—nobody likes to be criticized, especially for things that aren’t finished.


### What I've learned

> if you are a genius, it turns out that that’s not enough. `Geniuses still make mistakes, and having brilliant ideas and elite programming skills doesn’t guarantee that your software will be a hit.` 


👀
> The vast majority of the work at Google (and at most companies!) doesn’t require genius-level intellect, but 100% of the work requires a minimal level of social skills.


### 2-1-x. Why your intend to hide your work? 


- Not to regard you as not doing a good job before your work is done

- Not to take your ideas away from you before their complete their work


### 2-1-x. Disadvantages to hide what your work like

- less time to get collaboration to recieve reviews

- Difficult to get reviews and cooperation early on.

### 2-1-x. Advantages to share what your work like

- The more feedback you get early on, the less risk you take

My opinion:
```
The number of mistakes left is more and they are more diffuicult to correct, as time goes on

When you proceed without sharing your work, the number of bugs are more and moreover bugs are more difficult to correct.
