## 2-1. Overview

My summary:
- The following is the relationship of `trade-offs`:
  - **To work without reciving reviews.**
  - **To get reviews and cooperation, when you start working**

- Be kept in mind the following:
  - **To accept each other's way of working.**
  - To think about how to work efficiently. Even just a little.

### 2-1-1. Why you intend to hide your work? 

- Not to regard you as not doing a good job before your work is done

- Not to take your ideas away from you before their complete their work


### 2-1-2. Disadvantages to hide what your work like

- Less time to get collaboration to recieve reviews

- Difficulty to get reviews and cooperation early on.

### 2-1-2. Advantages to share what your work like

- The more feedback you get early on, the less risk you take


## 2-2. What I've been thinking

### 2-2-1. Working while reciving reviews v.s. without it

- I prefer the former
  - When you proceed without sharing your work, the number of bugs are more and moreover bugs are more difficult to correct.
  - However, I sometimes work at private until the work is done to some extent.
  - The reason is the same as what this chapter says.

- Working from home makes the following more difficult.
  - To share your work progress and some troubles.

### 2-2-2. Is Micro Management a necessary evil?

- I think it's unavoidable, what do you think?
