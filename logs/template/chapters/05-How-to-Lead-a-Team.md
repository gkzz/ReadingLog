## 5-1. Overview

### 5-1-1. Three types of engineering team's leader
- an engineering eanager
> `responsible for the performance, productivity, and happiness of every person on their team`—including their tech lead—while still making sure that the needs of the business are met by the product for which they are responsible.

-  tech lead (TL)
> `responsible for (surprise!) the technical aspects of the product, including technology decisions and choices, architecture, priorities, velocity, and general project management` (although on larger teams they might have program managers helping out with this). 


- a tech lead manager (TLM).
> a single person who can handle both the people and technical needs of their team.


### 5-1-2. Two reasons that nobody wants to be a manager
- To spend much less time writing code.
- To have expriences to work under bad managements.

### 5-1-3. About Servant Leadership

- Managers are requiered, as softwere enginieere should scale yourself.
- This chapter propose `servant leadership` as a management style

Servant leaders' role:
> you should strive to create an atmosphere of humility, respect, and trust. This might mean `removing bureaucratic obstacles that a team member can’t remove by themselves, helping a team achieve consensus`, or even buying dinner for the team when they’re working late at the office. 


> The only managing that a servant leader does is to manage both the technical and social health of the team;


#### My opinion

I'm not in favor of adopting `servant leadership` as a management style.

My reason is it is difficulty for servant leaders to play like their juniors.

## 5-2. What impressed me

I have the same opinion as the following:
 
> Good managers enable their engineering teams by helping them work well, keeping them focused on proper goals, and insulating them from problems outside the group, all while following the three pillars of humility, trust, and respect.
