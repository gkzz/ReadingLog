## 1-1. Overview

This book shows us the following question:

> Why is there no path for software architects?

The book's answers are as follows:

> the industry doesn’t have a good definition of software architecture itself.

> the role of software architect embodies a massive amount and scope of responsibility that continues to expand. 

> software architecture is a constantly moving target because of the rapidly evolving software development ecosystem.


## 1-1-1. What this chapter impressed me

- `an architecture review board (ABR)` is unfamilliar for me

Some impressive roles of architect are as follows

- Make Architecture Decisions
  - guide rather than specify technology choices

- Diverse Exposure and Experience
  > One of the best ways of mastering this expectation is for the architect to stretch their comfort zone.  it is far more valuable (略) and the associated pros and cons of each rather than to be an expert in only one of them.

- Does that mean that at some point you're going `to go into a specific non-IT industry` and gain domain knowledge?
  > The most successful architects we know are those who have broad, hands-on technical knowledge coupled with a strong knowledge of a particular domain.

## 1-2. What I learned

- Diffs between of SOA and Microservices
    - The following article says `complexity` 
      - [「マイクロサービス」のメリットをざっくり言うと「変化に対応しやすい」こと](https://knowledge.sakura.ad.jp/3377/)
    - When the SOA concept was used, it was XML. 
    - XML is a more complex specification than today's mainstream RESTful web API.
    - A complex (and expensive) middleware called an enterprise service buss (ESB) was needed to connect the system components with web services.
