## 4-1. Overview

This chapter says as follows:

- An architecture characteristic
  - some criteria
    > Specifies a nondomain design consideration
    > Influences some structural aspect of the design
    > Is critical or important to application success

### 4-1-1. My lesson

- Operational Architecture Characteristics (Availability, Continuity, etc.) from studying AWS-SAA, but the Structural Architecture Characteristics ( I didn't know about Configurability, Extensibility) and Cross-Cutting Architecture Characteristics (Accessibility, Archivability, etc.). I feel that my scattered knowledge has been cleared up.


- Agile development shows us the importance of repeated design reviews.
  - What to do if the design documentation for the current system goes away??
