## 0-1. Overview

This book illustrates as follows:

> This book looks at software architecture in modern light, taking into account all the innovations from the last decade, along with some new metrics and measures suited to todayâ€™s new structures and perspectives.

> While this book covers well-known patterns, we take a new approach, leaning on lessons learned, tools, engineering practices, and other input. We take many existing axioms in software architecture and rethink them in light of the current ecosystem, and design architectures, taking the modern landscape into account.
